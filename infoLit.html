      <h2>Information Literacy</h2>
        <p>
                   Information Literacy is the ability to thoroughly sift through information of various kinds, such as digital, paper, or physical, along with analyzing and thinking critically about it. It is not just about analyzing the information, but also about using it to further research in that area, both ethically and responsibly. When gathering evidence, I will have to be aware of what evidence supports the decisions of the competitive swimming community. The evidence must provide support for the specific structure and multimodal nature of the community. For example, the assignment “Synthesis matrix” allowed me to research secondary sources that aligned with the goals and communication patterns in swimming. They all discussed multimodality, while some were also specific to swimming, tailoring to the lexis, structure, and goals of the community. I had to skim through many secondary sources; some discussed multimodality, but with no relation to sports, and vice versa. I skimmed through these until I was able to find sources that discuss multimodality in the context of sports, or even swimming, ultimately allowing me to form a discussion within the critical conversation and relevant community of competitive swimming. Another example is in “Assignment: Outlining Your Research Paper,” where I analyzed my collected primary data for relevance. I had to determine which data contained any information that might be effective in answering my research question, requiring me to know my lines of inquiry and exactly what information would be relevant. Upon collecting the primary evidence of scoreboards, heat sheets, and swim sets, some elements within each genre did not necessarily support an answer to my question of how multimodality influences communication, structure, and performance. With that, I had to sift for any information within each document that may relate in any way to the question presented. Eventually, I successfully found evidence within each that connected to the contents of my question, ultimately providing me with an answer to their effects on structure, communication, and performance.
