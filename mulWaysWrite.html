    <h2>Multiple Ways of Writing</h2>
      <p>
        There is not one “correct way” of writing. In fact, there are many ways in which one can write. As Mirabelli mentioned, multiliteracies come into play within genres such as menus in a restaurant, where text is not the only form of communication; There are numbers, mannerisms, facial expressions, etc. One must identify their audience and be able to know what various forms of communication are appropriate for communicating what they want to say. For example, I have decided to study the multimodal nature of competitive swimming. With that, I will be working with multiple forms of communication in my research, meaning I will have to understand the different jargons and languages. Although these forms of communication will be similar since they are all within the sport of swimming, they contain different aspects since they display slightly different information. This difference will require multimodal fluency, allowing me to work with numbers, words, figures, etc. Through multiple ways of writing, I will have to consider the layout that the community of competitive swimming follows, its detailed structure, and its distinct reasoning for each modality used. An assignment that I can use for evidence of this outcome is “Assignment: Genre Analysis and Potential Research Questions,” where I considered the differing forms of communication, such as swim sets, scoreboards, and heat sheets. This required me to use numbers, unique terms, and specific acronyms to fit the community's expectations for multimodality. Another assignment that allowed me to explore multiple ways of writing is “Assignment: Coding Reflection and Generating Claims.” In this assignment, I was able to use tables and pictures to organize and display my primary evidence, effectively catering to my audience and delivering my analysis. With multiple ways of writing, I believe information can be better organized, displayed, and understood via a combination of text and visuals.
