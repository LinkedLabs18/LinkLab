    <h2>Generating Inquiry</h2>
      <p>
          To me, generating inquiry is the concept of not just proving something already known, but asking a question and pursuing the unknown. The goal of generating inquiry is to explore, find, and create, not just confirm what has already been found. During the past couple of weeks, I’ve been narrowing down a genre to research. I have been able to ask new questions and pursue data to give answers. I decided on the genre of competitive swimming communication, asking how the unique subgenres contribute to a multimodality that influences structure, communication, and performance. This has allowed me to analyze writing, language, and rhetoric in the sport of swimming, leading me to new inferences about the sport itself and its community. Regarding the competitive swimming community I am researching, some genre conventions I have to consider when generating inquiry are the use of technical lexis, the reflective and analytical nature of swimmers, community and motivation, and the audience I am generating inquiry for, whether that be other swimmers, coaches, or athletes in general. An assignment that I have completed that meets this outcome is my “Research proposal” submission. In this assignment, I was able to ask a question and present methods that revealed my knowledge of the community, their lexicon and jargon, their analytical nature, and their commitment and dedication. In the assignment “Annotated Bibliography and Literature Review,” I was able to explore secondary sources, enter their critical conversations, and explore how my research question fits in. By exploring their findings, I could further understand what my question means and why it's important. For example, my question pondered the significance of multimodalities in competitive swimming and their influence on structure, performance, and communication; by entering the critical conversation of those who explored multimodality in sports, I could better understand multimodality as it applies to competitive swimming.
