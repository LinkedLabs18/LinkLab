             <h2>My Cover Letter</h2>
             <p>
                    At the beginning of ENC 1102, I had relatively negative, narrow feelings towards writing and research. I had a one size fits all template and style for writing in my mind,
                one that follows the same conventions every time, with no diversity or change, regardless of my audience. I thought the course was going to be another dry, repetitive atmosphere, dragging me through the depths of endless writing rules. However, I couldn’t have been farther from the truth. In this course, I met something new, something that showed me that writing doesn’t have to be restrained; it doesn’t have to be the same, tedious flow every time. Yes, it should follow the expectations of your audience, but that really just comes out of respect. You’re free to write about anything, anywhere, however you want, and I think 
                that's the most critical thing I learned in ENC 1102. I started the semester learning about critical conversations and discourse communities, and how writing generally differs not only by the topic you are writing about, but also for the audience you are writing for. I learned that it is respected to listen in on the community you desire to join, understand their conventions, 
                and then upon understanding enough about the critical conversation, form your own opinion and present it, doing your best to follow the communities expectations for presentation and communication. Throughout the course, I found myself with opportunities to explore a discourse community, analyze the genres by which they communicate, and how their community functions around those norms of communication to meet their goals. So, by now, I feel that I have expanded my knowledge of writing in a way that, I guess, frees me. I don’t have to worry about a five paragraph rule, or my thesis statement, or whether I have five sentences in a paragraph; The only thing that concerns my writing is the expectations of the audience, that is if I wish to fulfill them, otherwise I would be completely free to write about anything, however I want, which is sometimes ideal too. To summarize, writing is a lot less restrictive than most give it credit for, and ENC 1102 has taught me just that. If I can write freely and understand my audience, I’ll be golden.
