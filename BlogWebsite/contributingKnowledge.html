    <h2>My Cover Letter</h2>
      <p>
          Contributing knowledge involves forming an opinion about what certain evidence analyzed means. One can look at multiple sources of a similar community and form new information from their views and what they think about the things they are researching. They can then propose these new opinions to the community, ultimately sparking discussion and opportunities for further development in that specific community. For the course outcome of Contributing Knowledge, I drew conclusions by discussing the genre elements that structure and influence the swimming community. This included breaking down each element of the various genres by which the community communicates. Upon doing so, the effects of such elements were revealed, allowing for the construction of a claim revealing how the community is affected and why they use such methods to communicate. Upon providing this work to the community, I am effectively contributing knowledge to the critical conversation. An assignment that completes this outcome is the “Major Assignment 1: Literature Review and Annotated Bibliography,” where I drew conclusions from the secondary sources I collected, contributing to the analysis of multimodality and structure in the sport of swimming. By synthesizing knowledge from various secondary sources, I formed a discussion around multimodality in swimming that I could pair with primary evidence to ultimately provide claims to the critical conversation. Likewise, in “Assignment: Outlining Your Research Paper,” I analyzed primary data, drew conclusions, and made claims about its representation and how it contributes to reflecting the importance of multimodality in sports. One last assignment that reflects contributing knowledge is “Major Assignment 2: Research Paper,” where I synthesized my primary research with my secondary research, leading to my development of a claim about multimodality in competitive swimming. With that claim and the analysis I provided, I successfully filled the gap in the critical conversation and contributed adequate knowledge. In summary, from the analysis in these assignments, I concluded the effects of visual elements on communication, performance, and structure, ultimately contributing to the conversation of multimodality in sports.
