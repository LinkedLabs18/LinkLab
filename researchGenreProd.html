    <h2>Research Genre Production</h2>
      <p>
        Research genre production, I think, is the ability to understand specific genres within certain communities. They understand the specific lexis certain communities use, and why they do what they do, and communicate the way they do. Research genre production requires one to almost become a part of that community, as they dive in and understand its foundations and choices. Being part of the swimming community, I can understand the parameters in which they operate, and I understand the choices and restraints I will be working with relating to the multimodal communications within the community. In terms of research genre production, this in itself requires me to adhere to the choices of the community. For example, the “Assignment: Reading Response and Discussion: Researching your Genre and Refined Questions” allowed me to show my knowledge on this, where I navigated the unique layout and structure of the swimming community, along with the different forms of communication used. I analyzed and understood the fast-paced, shorthand style of communication and the disciplined, focused atmosphere, allowing me to structure my writing in such a way that adheres to those choices. In other words, upon analyzing the community of competitive swimming, I found I entered a genre that expects a detailed format and quick, efficient communication, requiring my writing to also be detailed and efficiently structured. A second assignment in which I completed Research Genre Production is “Assignment: Coding Reflection and Generating Claims,” where I understood the conventions of the competitive swimming community and formed claims that answered the question of how and why multimodality in the sport improves structure, communication, and performance. I understood the elements that positively structure the community, such as shorthand notation, colors, and other visuals, allowing me to accurately build and display claims about the community while respecting the expectations of a serious and detailed format.
