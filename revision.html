      <h2>Revision</h2>
      <p>
          Revision is the ability to take constructive criticism from others to improve their work. Students work to better each other's work by forming their opinions about one another's drafts, ultimately contributing knowledge to each other, resulting in a sharper finished product. I have not done too much revision yet, only based on bits and pieces of feedback from my professor on my genre selection. Revision is the element in which I will take my classmate's feedback and accurately apply it to my research, bettering it for its intended audience. Some elements I will need to consider regarding my community and revision are the elements portrayed and the tone. Are the expectations for a detailed structure, specific lexis, and multimodal analysis met? Is there a serious, accurate, straightforward tone in the paper? The answer to these questions should be yes. By implementing revision, my audience’s expectations and the content of the research will be more aligned. An assignment that meets this outcome is “Assignment: Peer Review of Lit Review / Annotated Bib,” where I obtained feedback on my research and applied it to align my paper more towards its intended purpose. This allowed me to work with others and utilize outside opinions to better my work, ultimately better aligning it with the rubric and expectations of my genre. Another example of revision is “ePortfolio Check-In #4”, where I revised my course outcomes to be updated and relevant to reflect my work thus far in the course. By adding more examples for each outcome, correcting grammar, and extending analysis, I performed revision and successfully met the Revision course outcome. A third assignment that fulfills this outcome is “Week 13 In-Class Conference Reflection.” This assignment allowed me to reflect on the conference with my professor, where we discussed plans for revision of Major Assignment 2. By discussing how the assignment could be revised, the course outcome of Revision was met. Each of these critical assignments revealed my understanding and execution of revision, ultimately solidifying my understanding and completion of the course outcome, Revision.
